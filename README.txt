This is a project I worked on during my Computer Graphics and Computer Graphics 2 classes. This project shows the rendering of objects using OpenGL and rendering effects like glow, skyboxes, reflections, etc. 

To use:
	First, download the .zip file called OpenGL_Project and to run the project, 
	open the 'main.py' file and run it. A small window should appear and after a
	couple seconds of a white screen, it should render a room. There is no 	collision detection so you can go through objects and such. 	

	wasd = to move the camera
	moving mouse = look around
